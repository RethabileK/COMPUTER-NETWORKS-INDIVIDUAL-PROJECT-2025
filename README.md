## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the design, configuration, and documentation of multiple network topologies using **Cisco Packet Tracer**. The work is divided into three main parts as required by the CMPG 325 project specification:

### **Part I: Network Topologies Design & Simulation (60%)**
- Developed and simulated **five distinct topologies**:
  1. **Bus Topology** 
  2. **Mesh Topology**
  3. **Star Topology**
  4. **Ring Topology**
  5. **Extended Star Topology**
- Configured using both **IPv4 and IPv6 addressing**.
-Created a **Hybrid Topology** configured using both **IPv4 and IPv6 addressing**, implemented **VLAN segmentation**, Integrated at least one **server** (HTTP, DNS, and DHCP) , and **basic security**.

---

### **Part II: Individual Network Feature Configuration (20%)**
- Designed and configured a **Wireless Mesh Network** with IPv6.
- Demonstrated **individual network features** including:
  - SSID configuration
  - Static addressing
  - Device connectivity verification

---

### **Part III: Video Demonstration (20%)**
- A **15–30 minute video presentation** presenting the project.

## Documentation Files

| File Name | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `IP ADDRESSING TABLES.pdf` | Detailed IPv4 and IPv6 address plan for all topologies |
| `successful_data_exchange_evidence` | Screenshots of successful data exchange |
| `topology_descriptions.md` | Description of all 7 network topologies and their functionality |
| `video` |The link to the presentation video |

## Successful Data Exchange Evidence
All configurations were verified through:
- **Ping tests** (IPv4 and IPv6) between VLANs and departments    
- **Traceroute analysis** confirming proper routing paths  
- **Wireless mesh connectivity** verification  

---

## Reflection & Lessons Learned
Throughout this project:
- Gained experience in  network design and configuration using Cisco Packet Tracer .  
- Enhanced understanding of VLANs, subnetting, and routing.  
- Developed documentation and version control skills through GitHub commits and gained experience on using GitHub.
- Learned the difference between the topologies and understood how each structure affects perfomance, realibility and collusion.
- Gained experience on assigning IPv4 and IPv6 addresses and verifying communication.
- Understood the importance of subnetting and gateways for proper routing and connectivity.

## Video Demonstration
The demonstration video (available in the `video` folder) includes:
1. Network design explanation  
2. Configuration steps for IPv4 and IPv6  
3. Testing connectivity and verifying services   
4. Final reflections and conclusion
